# UrFriends

The goal of this app is to help people to build and maintain relationships

The initial concept was inspired by things like:
 - Benjamin Franklin's daily routines
 - Bill Clinton's uncanny "ability" to recall names, faces, and conversations (He and his team kept detailed notes on everyone he met)
 - Marcus Aurelius's Meditations... was his *personal* journal
 - My grandmother Faye, who had an immense social circle and maintained it with a cheap address book and a landline
 - The non-interaction that has come with many contemporary forms of social media

 ### TODO:
